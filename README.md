# Care Band ‚Äì ESP32 Device

The **Care Band ESP32 firmware** powers the wearable device for dementia patients.  
It provides **energy-efficient home detection, GPS fallback, and fall detection**.  
If the patient leaves home or experiences a fall, caregivers are notified through the mobile app.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Learns and stores known Wi-Fi BSSIDs during setup.
- Checks every 5 minutes if connected to home Wi-Fi.
- Falls back to nearby BSSIDs if not directly connected.
- Uses GPS only if Wi-Fi checks fail (energy-efficient).
- **Fall detection support** with caregiver notification.
- Sends data to the server via Oracle HTTP ‚Üí Render.
- Caregivers notified if the patient:
  - Might have left home (no Wi-Fi + no GPS).
  - Has truly left home (confirmed GPS).
  - Has experienced a fall (location shared).

## üöÄ Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Replace the current server credentials with your own.
3. Flash the firmware to an ESP32 using Arduino IDE.
4. Ensure Oracle HTTP relay and Care Band Server are running.
